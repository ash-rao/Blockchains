# Blockchains
Basic implementation of blockchain in java using GUI with swing and multithreading used for a secure voting system

In this project, we implement a blockchain using Java for a voting application. As the data generated when someone places their vote must be confidential and secure, blockchains are used to provide an extra level of security to the vote transactions generated.
	This project aims to create a secure user friendly java application for voting. It allows users with valid voter ID to login to the application and vote for their respective party. Once the vote is submitted, it is irreversible. For each vote placed, a block with the voter ID and party ID encrypted together is added to the blockchain 

  The project has been implemented in Java 1.8 and tested on Eclipse Oxygen for Windows. It is compatible with other Windows systems as well as Linux based systems.

Description of text files used -
Login File - Contains all valid voter ID
Party File - Contains all parties taking part in the election
Bchain - Contains objects of all the blocks in the blockchain in binary format
